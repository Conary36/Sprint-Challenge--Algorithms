#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
   The While loop is O(n), 
   a = a + n * n is O(n) when constant of 2 is dropped
   simplifying the addition of O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

b)
    The sum is a constant of O(1)
    For loop is O(1), J = 1 is O(1)
    While loop is O(1) J *= 2 is O(2n)
    simplifying the constants equates to O(n)

c)
    If bunnies == 0 is a constant of O(1)
    n will decrement by 1 and increased by 2 O(1)
    simplified to be a constant O(1)
