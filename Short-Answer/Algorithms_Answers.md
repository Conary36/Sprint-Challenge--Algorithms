#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a)
   The While loop is O(n), 
   a = a + n * n is O(n) when constant of 2 is dropped
   simplifying the addition of O(n) + O(n) = O(n)

b)
    The sum is a constant of O(1)
    For loop is O(1), J = 1 is O(1)
    While loop is O(n) J *= 2 is O(log n)
    simplifying the constants equates to O(n log n)

c)
    n will decrement by 1 and increase by 2 O(n)
    simplified to be a constant O(n)

## Exercise II


While eggs are dropped,
For floors greater than mid level,
check if eggs are broken,
if broken decrement,
For Floors less than mid level,
check if eggs are not broken,
if not broken add to basket
